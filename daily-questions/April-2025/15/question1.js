// Interview Question 1: Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript.
// Then, write a function that compares two values using both operators
// and returns a message explaining whether they are loosely or strictly equal.

// For example:
// Input: compareValues(5, '5')
// Output: "'5' and 5 are equal with == but not with ==="

// Input: compareValues(5, 5)
// Output: "5 and 5 are equal with both == and ==="

// Input: compareValues(0, false)
// Output: "0 and false are equal with == but not with ==="
