// Interview Question 3:
// Imagine you're building a scheduling system. Write a function that determines if two time intervals overlap.
// Each interval is represented by an object with `start` and `end` properties (in 24-hour format).
//
// For example:
// Input:
// { start: 9, end: 12 },
// { start: 11, end: 13 }
// Output: true  (because 11â€“12 overlaps)
//
// Input:
// { start: 14, end: 16 },
// { start: 16, end: 18 }
// Output: false (they touch at 16 but don't overlap)
