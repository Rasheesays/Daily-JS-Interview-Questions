// Interview Question 5: Deep Clone of an Object
// Write a function that performs a deep clone of an object. A deep clone means
// that the properties of the object, including nested objects, are copied over to
// the new object without affecting the original object.

// Example:
// Input: const obj = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
// Output: const clonedObj = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
// The cloned object should not be affected by changes to the original object, and vice versa.

// How would you approach this problem and what is the expected output when manipulating both the original and cloned objects?
