// üß© Code with Detailed Explanations
// ===============================

/*
 * In JavaScript, primitive values like numbers are assigned by value, not by reference.
 * 
 * Here's what happens step-by-step:
 * 1. `a` is initialized with the value 10.
 * 2. `b` is assigned the value of `a`, so `b` becomes 10.
 * 3. `a` is then updated to 20, but this does not affect `b` because it already received its copy.
 * 
 * So `b` still holds the original value of 10.
