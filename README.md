# 💻 Daily JavaScript Interview Challenges

Welcome to my **Daily JavaScript Interview Challenges** repository!

---

## 📖 Project Description

This repository contains a growing collection of JavaScript interview questions and solutions, tackled and documented daily — with a target of solving 5 questions each day. Each solution is thoughtfully written to be easy to understand, with added explanations and learning resources to benefit anyone looking to sharpen their JavaScript skills.

While building this up, I'm also using it as a way to stay sharp, explore different approaches, and create something useful for others who are preparing for interviews or deepening their understanding of the language.

You're encouraged to attempt each question on your own first — it's the best way to learn!

It also serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to practice JavaScript interview questions and solutions.

## 📂 How to Use This Repo

Each day has its own folder (e.g., `2025-April/10/`) containing `.js` files for each question.  
_(P.S. Yep — April 10th, 2025, is when the journey officially began 🚀. Let’s see how far this goes!😄)_
Each file follows a consistent structure with clearly labeled sections:

1. ✅ **Final Solution (Code Only)**
2. 🧩 **Code With Explanatory Comments**
3. 📘 **Key Concepts and What to Know**
4. ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls and Mistakes to Avoid**
5. 🔗 **Helpful Resources and Documentation**

> 🧠 **Tip:** _Try to solve each question on your own before viewing the solution — that's where the real learning happens!_
